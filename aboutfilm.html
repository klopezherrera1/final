        <h6>Minolta X-370</h6>
        <p>The Minolta X-370s is a 35mm SLR film camera that was introduced by Minolta in 1981. It is a manual focus camera with aperture-priority and manual exposure modes. The X-370s features a built-in light meter that provides accurate exposure readings for a wide range of lighting conditions. It has a metal chassis and a durable construction, making it a reliable camera for both amateurs and professionals. The camera has a vertical-travel, metal-blade focal plane shutter with speeds ranging from 1 to 1/1000 seconds, as well as a bulb mode for long exposures. It has a bright viewfinder with a split-image focusing screen and a microprism collar, making it easy to achieve precise focus.

        This camera was my first analog camera, and it has been with me since 2015. It is the camera I use the most and one of my favorites.
        </p>
        <h6>Canon F1</h6>
        <p>The Canon F-1 is a 35 mm single-lens reflex camera produced by Canon of Japan from March 1971 until the end of 1981, at which point it had been superseded by the New F-1 launched earlier that year. The Canon FD lens mount was introduced along with the F-1, but the previous Canon FL-mount lenses and older R- series lenses were also compatible with the camera with some limitations.

        This camera has been with me since 2022. It is my favorite for ISO 800 film rolls, night shots, and portraits.
        </p>
         <h7>The rolls we use are 35mm: Kodak Ultramax, Kodak Gold, CineStill 400, and 800.</h7>
